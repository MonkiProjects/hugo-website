      ### A map, no clutter

      No matter how much data you want on the map, we do our best to make it beautiful and clear. We won't put tons of useless data – it's better for you, your storage, the network… well, it's better for everyone 🙂

      ### Satellite view in one tap

      We know how it works to find a spot for training… and it very often involves a satellite view 🗺 In one tap, you can switch between a clean view and one with every little details you could see from the sky.

      ### Fast spot creation

      We promise you, it would hardly be faster to create a spot ⚡️ We designed a very intuitive interface which allows you to add plenty of details in just a few taps and swipes.

      ### Even faster… don't finish creating the spot!

      Sometimes you just don't have time to write a name, and we got your back 😉 At the exact moment you create a spot, it's saved – no need to worry about loosing it. You can then find it in your drafts and add more details later.

      ### Even less clutter with filtering

      We have our view on what the map should look like, but you probably have your own. That's why we added a powerful search bar with thoughtful filters.

      ### Show only what matters to **you**

      What if you wanted to see only the spots in your city where you could train your "kong-precision" even when walls are wet? Well, it would take 3 filters, and a very intuitive search bar.

      ### A handy search bar

      As you start filtering places, we remove the filters that doesn't make sense anymore, to leave only what you need.

      ### A beautiful dark mode

      Like our website, Monki Map is designed with a dark mode in mind. We want it to look gorgeous in every situation. <small>Maybe one day you'll be able to choose between themes… but that's a different story 🙈</small>
