One of the key features of Monki Map is its advanced search and filtering. To make it work, we need to add meaningful data to each spot, and "categorize it". Being a practitioner, I already know some things which make a spot better than another, or why I would tain at a spot and not another at a particular time. But I don't know every spot, and I don't want the data to be biased, so I'd like you to share your thoughts on my actual categorization.

That's why I created the following Google Sheets. If you want to contribute, you can:

- Open the ["Parkour Placemarks" spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rlVB6HAOHgvqnQDtstfvy6zwYsYKq1xPE6Q_ZHPqWUw/edit?usp=sharing), and **leave comments**.
- Reach out to me through [our Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/monkiprojects/), [my Discord](https://discord.com) (`RÃ©mi Bardon#1471`) our via email at remi@monkiprojects.com, and I'll give you **write access**.
