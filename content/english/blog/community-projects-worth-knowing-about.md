## International projects

### MÜVMAG Magazine

> MÜV Magazine is the parkour culture magazine created by the community for the community.
>
> Currently, parkour is where skateboarding was before it became huge. There are parkour gyms and parks sprouting up all over the world, practitioners creating their own fashion brands, major events with huge sponsors and even high-profile sponsorships for athletes. What started as a few friends playing together has turned into something unbelievable. We believe that this is just the beginning.
>
> Everyone deserves to be able to do what they want in life and our hope is that MÜV Magazine will provide a foundation for the future of careers in parkour. Currently, there aren’t many choices and we want to expand the possibilities.
